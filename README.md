## About

**Hi there!** I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 1 years of experience in the IT industry. I started my career as a Full Stack Developer, but I quickly realized that I was more interested in the operations side of things. I've since worked on a variety of projects, including:

* Building and maintaining a large-scale web application 🚀
* Deploying and scaling containerized applications 🚢

I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems and make people's lives easier. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
